        <p>A Komodo Resource will work best if</p>

        <ul class="disc">
            <li>It's hosted on its own GitHub repository</li>

            <li>It has a readme in the root of its repository</li>

            <li>It utilizes GitHub releases to distribute downloadable copies of the resource</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Although all of the above is optional, we highly encourage you to follow these guidelines.</p>

        <h2>I Work by Example - Just show me the goods (TLDR)</h2>

        <p>
            Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Komodo/Komodo-Resources">
            Komodo-Resources repository</a> on GitHub.
        </p>

        <h2>Creating a Resource</h2>
        <p>
            For information on how to get started with your own resource please
            check the
            <a href="/customize">Customize Komodo page</a>.
        </p>

        <h2 id="adding-a-resource">Adding a Resource</h2>

        <p>There are 3 ways to add a resource, fully-automatic, semi-automatic and manual. Both the automatic ways require you to use GitHub as described above.</p>

        <p>Whatever method you use, you will need to start by forking the
        <a href="https://github.com/Komodo/Komodo-Resources">Komodo-Resources repository</a>.
        Edit the category file that your Resource relates to and follow one of the steps outlined below.</p>

        <h3 id="automatic">Automatic</h3>

        <p>With Automatic resources all you do is supply the name and GitHub url of your resource, we will take care of the rest. To do this, use the following format:</p>
        <pre><code class="hl yaml">Resource Name: https://github.com/MyUsername/MyRepository</code></pre>

        <h3 id="semi-automatic">Semi-Automatic</h3>

        <p>Say you want us to retrieve all your repository data for you, but you want to override certain information that is being supplied by GitHub. You can do this by using the following format:</p>
        <pre>
            <code class="hl yaml">Resource Name:
    html_url: https://github.com/MyUsername/MyRepository # Required
    owner: login: MyOtherNickname # Example
    readme: 
        content: >
                  Foo # Example</code>
        </pre>

        <p>To find out what fields you can override please check out the <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#get">Github API documentation</a></p>

        <h3 id="manual">Manual</h3>

        <p>Say you're not using GitHub or your repository structure is not supported by our parser, you can then manually provide us with all of your Resource information.</p>

        <p>You do this by providing us with your Resource information formatted in the same way as a repository is formatted in the <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#get">Github API documentation</a>.</p>

        <pre>
        <code class="hl yaml">Resource Name:
    # Required Fields
    owner:
        login: MyName
        gravatar_id: fbf0600881da69934bad33192694d484 # Optional

    readme:

    homepage: https://..</code>
        </pre>

        <h2>Submitting The Resource</h2>

        <p>
            Once you are done making the changes make a
            <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request">pull request</a>
            against the main Komodo-Resources repository, we will then review
            your request and ask for changes, accept it or reject it as is relevant.</p>

        <p>
            Note that changes will not instantly take effect, the Komodo Resources
            section is updated only once every hour.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="pane-blogs" class="hide">
        <h1>Blogs</h1>
        <p>
            We accept blogs from anyone willing to submit content that is in some
            way Komodo related. Your blog does not need to have Komodo as its main
            topic, for example you can submit blogs for:
        </p>
        <ul class="disc">
            <li>
                How you created your website using technology X
            </li>
            <li>
                What tools you're using to automate your workflow
            </li>
            <li>
                What macro's / snippets / etc. you've developed to help you with your work
            </li>
            <li>
                Etc.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>
            Submitting a Blog
        </h2>
        <p>
            Blogs can be written entirely in markdown, so you don't need to run
            a copy of the Komodo Website just to test your blog - use any markdown
            editor you prefer.
        </p>
        <p>
            To submit your blog you need to:
        </p>
        <ol class="decimal">
            <li>
                Fork the
                <a href="https://github.com/Komodo/komodo-website">Komodo-Website repository</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                Create your blog under the
                <a href="https://github.com/Komodo/komodo-website/tree/master/src/pages/blog">
                    relevant date folder
                </a><br>
                <em>if the right date folder does not exist create it.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
                Create your blog file using the format <code>title-of-my-blog.hmtl.md</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                Use the following template for the start of your blog:
                <pre>
                    <code>---
title: Title of My Blog
author: My Name
date: YYYY-MM-DD

                </pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                Write your blog underneath using Markdown or HTML
            </li>
            <li>
                Once done, commit your changes and submit a
                <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request">pull request</a>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div id="pane-screencasts" class="hide">
        <h1>Screencasts</h1>
        <p>
            We currently do not have a workflow set up yet to contribute screencasts.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you would like to submit a screencast please email us at
            <a href="mailto:komodo@activestate.com?subject=Screencast%20Submission">komodo@activestate.com</a> with a link to your video.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="pane-code" class="hide">
        <h1>Code</h1>
        <p>
            To contribute actual code to Komodo Edit (and indirectly Komodo IDE)
            you can fork the
            <a href="https://github.com/Komodo/KomodoEdit">Komodo Edit repository on github</a>.
            From there your first step will be to
            <a href="https://github.com/Komodo/KomodoEdit/blob/master/README.md#building-komodo">
                get your own Komodo build going</a>
            so you can test your changes.
            <br>
            Once you have your build going there are two ways you can contribute
            to Komodo development:
        </p>

        <h2>Solving Bugs</h2>
        <p>
            Want to get your hands dirty? You can
            <a href="http://bugs.activestate.com/query.cgi?bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&list_id=57713&product=Komodo&query_format=advanced" target="_blank">
                search for open bugs on our Bug Tracker
            </a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            To be able to fix a bug you'll need to get your own build of Komodo Edit
            running; you can
            <a href="https://github.com/Komodo/KomodoEdit">
                obtain the source and instructions from our GitHub repository
            </a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            To avoid working on a bug that is already being worked on by someone else,
            please express your intent in the bug report before starting.
        </p>

        <h2>Implementing Features</h2>
        <p>
            Just like with bugs, you can
            <a href="http://bugs.activestate.com/query.cgi?bug_severity=7-enhancement&bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&list_id=57713&product=Komodo&query_format=advanced" target="_blank">
                search our Bug Tracker
            </a>
            for open Enhancement requests.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have your own idea for a feature that you would like to implement
            that you think should be part of the core Komodo experience, please
            <a href="bugs.activestate.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=Komodo&bug_severity=7-enhancement">
            file an enhancement request</a> for it and express your intent to implement it.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="pane-bugs" class="hide">
        <h1>Bug Reports</h1>
        <p>
            The most obvious way to help any software project is to
            <a href="http://bugs.activestate.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=Komodo" target="_blank">report bugs</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you really want to help out with this we'd encourage you to try our
            <a href="http://downloads.activestate.com/Komodo/nightly/">
            nightly builds</a> and help us catch bugs early.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="pane-documentation" class="hide">
        <h1>Documentation</h1>
        <p>
            Writing documentation is a big part of any software project. We plan to put
            a lot of focus on this with the new website. As it stands the documentation
            is still at its <a href="http://docs.activestate.com/komodo">old location</a>,
            but we've already started moving the source to github.
        </p>

        <p>
            To contribute to our documentation you can fork the
            <a href="https://github.com/Komodo/komodo-documentation">
                komodo-documentation repository
            </a>
            and start submitting
            <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request">pull requests</a>
            .
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="pane-other" class="hide">
        <h1>Other</h1>
        <p>
            If you wish to contribute in some other way please
            <a href="http://forum.komodoide.com/">post about it on our forums</a>.
            We will let you know what the best procedure is for getting your
            contributions used in our projects.
