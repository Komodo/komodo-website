    comment: "Komodo helps the Icinga development in not only C and C++ programming, but also native script languages such as Perl or PHP. Compared to other cross-platform IDEs it's fast, responsive and and  offers a huge set of configuration and customization capabilities. Especially when working with a large number of files and directory structures as we do in Icinga."

    comment: "Komodo doesn't just act as an IDE for Python but is also a very accomplished Perl, PHP, and Tcl IDE providing all the standard features like code highlighting and folding along with code completion. The Rx Toolkit is so advanced it could quite easily be a mini standalone app as it provides not only matching of text and highlighting but also shows the data that would appear in the various group matches."
