        <h1>Addons / Iconsets / Skins / Languages</h1>
        
        <p>
            Iconsets, Skins and Languages are all packaged as Addons, therefore
            their installation steps are the same.

        <h2>Installing An .xpi File</h2>
        <p>
            If the downloaded addon is in "xpi" format or includes an *.xpi file
            you can simply drag the xpi file onto Komodo and follow the
            installation steps.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once installed restart Komodo for the addon to be properly loaded.
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>
                The steps below are only relevant if installing via an .xpi file
                is not possible for you.

        </p>

        <a name="installsource"></a>
        <h2>Installing from Source</h2>
        <p>
            Some addon developers do not supply a compiled version of their addon,
            we strongly urge addon devs to always compile their addons but we
            can't control what other people do. If you want to install an addon
            which has not been compiled yet, follow the following steps;
        </p>

        <a name="buildxpi"></a>
        <h3>Build Using koext</h3>
        <ol class="decimal">
            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/Komodo/KomodoEdit/tree/master/src/sdk" target="_blank">
                    Put the Komodo SDK dir on your PATH
                </a>
            </li>
            <li>
                Using your command prompt enter the directory containing the install.rdf for the addon you
                are trying to install
            </li>
            <li>
                Run <code>koext build</code><br>
                <small><strong>Note:</strong> be sure to check the readme for the
                addon you are using, as this step may vary per addon, for example
                some addons may need you to run <code>koext build --unjarred</code></small>
            </li>
            <li>
                If succesful an .xpi file will appear alongside the install.rdf
                which you can use to install the addon using the
                <a href="#installxpi">Installing An .xpi File</a> steps above
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            If these steps are not working or you want to try a different approach
            you can try manually creating an .xpi, but this is not guaranteed to work
            for every addon.
        </p>

        <a name="manualxpi"></a>
        <h3>Manually Create .xpi</h3>
        <ol class="decimal">
            <li>
                Enter the folder containing the install.rdf for the addon you are
                trying to install
            </li>
            <li>
                Select all files and create a ZIP archive from them (these steps
                may very depending on your OS & ZIP application)
            </li>
            <li>
                Rename the extension for the generated ZIP from .zip to .xpi, eg.
                <code>foo.zip</code> becomes <code>foo.xpi</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                Use the newly created xpi file to install the addon using the
                <a href="#installxpi">Installing An .xpi File</a> steps above
            </li>
        </ol>

    <div id="pane-macro" class="hide">
        <h1>Macros / Snippets / Tools (toolbox)</h1>

        <h2>Drag and Drop</h2>
        <p>
            To install toolbox items simply open up your Komodo toolbox and
            drag and drop the downloaded *.komodotool onto your toolbox.
        </p>

        <h2>Import</h2>
        <p>
            Alternatively you can choose to import items right from inside Komod.
            Simply open your toolbox and click the "gear" icon at the top right
            of the Toolbox widget. Then select the import option that applies
            to the type of file you are currently importing.
        </p>

        <h2>Manual Import</h2>
        <p>
            Sometimes you will find a Macro or Snippet that isn't packaged in a
            format Komodo understand, eg. you simply have a snippet of code that
            you want to use in Komodo. To use this, simply open your Komodo
            toolbox and create a tool (eg. Macro, Snippet, Command) by either
            clicking the "gear" icon at the top right of the Toolbox widget, or
            by right clicking the folder to which you want to add your tool.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then simply copy and paste the code you wish to import into the
            tool creation dialog.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="pane-colorscheme" class="hide">
        <h1>Color Schemes</h1>

        <h2>Drag and Drop</h2>
        <p>
            To install color schemes simply drag and drop the downloaded *.ksf file
            onto Komodo.
        </p>

        <h2>Manual Import</h2>
        <p>
            If for whatever reason the Drag and Drop solution does not work you
            can manually install the color scheme by copying the *.ksf file to
            your schemes folder, which is located within your profile folder.
        </p>
        <p>
            In most cases, the path of this folder will be:
        </p>
        <ul class="disc">
            <li>
                <strong>Windows:</strong>

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Once you have copied the *.ksf file to this folder, restart Komodo and
            follow the Usage steps below.
        </p>

        <h2>Usage</h2>
        <p>
            Once installed you can select (and tweak) your color schemes under
            <code>Preferences > Fonts and Colors</code>.

    <div id="pane-keybinding" class="hide">
        <h1>Keybindings</h1>

        <h2>Importing</h2>
        <p>
            You can install keybindings by copying the *.kkf file to
            your schemes folder, which is located within your profile folder.
