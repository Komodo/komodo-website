It will highlight keybindings that conflict with each-other.  It can also compare and contrast different keybinding schemes. It can also include a \"groomed\" version of the original \"keybindings by category\" tables with the keys dressed nice to read them, again showing conflicting keys and comparing/contrasting different schemes.  When the groomed category tables are included, page display options include one full page, side-by-side, or top-over-bottom stacked. There is also a navigation menu with quick-click to each key, and if included, category tables.
