  comment: "Capable of running just as powerfully on the Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows platforms, Komodo is the best IDE I've used to write Perl, Python, Ruby scripts and Web applications. And because it looks and performs identically on these operating systems and languages, I feel instantly at home and productive regardless of what OS I'm running it on."

  comment: "I've been a Komodo customer for almost five years, and couldn't imagine using another editor for my work with dynamic languages. Komodo IDE syntax highlights and auto-completes my Perl, Ruby, XML, SQL, HTML and CSS, allowing my team to write better code more quickly than we ever have."
